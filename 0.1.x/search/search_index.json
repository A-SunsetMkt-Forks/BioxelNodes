However, we found that there were many details that were not addressed in place, some scientific facts were ignored, and the volume rendering was not pretty enough. With Bioxel Nodes, you can easily import the volumetric data into Blender, and more importantly, it can quickly make a beautiful realistic rendering of it.</p> <p>Below are some examples with Bioxel Nodes. Thanks to Cycles Render, the volumetric data can be rendered with great detail:</p> <p></p> <p>The \"Bioxel\" in \"BioxelNodes\", is a combination of the words \"Bio-\" and \"Voxel\". Bioxel is a voxel that stores biological data. The volumetric data made up of Bioxel is called Bioxels. We are developing a toolkit around Bioxels for better biological data visualization. but before its release, we made this Blender version of bioxels toolkit first, in order to let more people to have fun with volumetric data.

All the parameters are straightforward, you can understand them by changing the values.</p> <p>The node, that named \"Segment\", is a preset node that combines the steps of 3D reconstruction process and shading process. In general, you need to add one of the segmentation node to reconstruction first, and followed by one of the shader node to set the shader.

However, when Bioxels is imported into 3D CG software, its size in the software is not scaled by reading the Meter pre unit directly.

Node-based operations ensure that the original data is not permanently altered during reconstruction and rendering operations.

Look for more support for OpenVDB in GeometryNodes so that Bioxel Nodes can do more in the future.</p>"}]}
