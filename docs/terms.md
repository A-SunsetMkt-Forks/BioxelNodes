### Bioxels

Bioxels is based on the RAS coordinate system, Right Aanterior Superior, which was chosen over LPS because it is more compatible with most 3D CG software coordinate systems, and is in line with the 3D artist's understanding of space.

All distances within Bioxels are in Units, and are specified in Meter pre unit. However, when Bioxels is imported into 3D CG software, its size in the software is not scaled by reading the Meter pre unit directly. The reason for this is that many 3D operations in software require that the primtives not be too large or too small.
